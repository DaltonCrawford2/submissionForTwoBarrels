About Project:

From Febuary 2016 to June 2018, I worked as a Documet Specialist for One Legal LLC, an attorney services company.
Here, my job function was to prepare documents and coordinate service of process taking place outside the state of California.

Due to word of mouth, the Director of Engineering came by my desk for a chat about my intentions. 
In attempts to help and also see my ability level, a project was assigned. If successful, the discussed plan of action was to bring me over to eventually serve as a Front End Developer.

The project in question:
I was given twelve image files, these images were to be arranged on a page and the user was to be able to rearrange the image order via dragging and dropping.

At the time of assignment, I had not used HTML for web page development at all. Only basic <b><u>STYLIZATION</u></b>. 
Although, I had grown comfortable hitting F12 while in Google Chrome and searching through the website's code in order to better understand the structure.

This project was given to me on a Friday afternoon, I used my weekend to crash course and refresh on HTML and finished the primary objective by Tuesday. 

I will supply the only found copy of this project.
It is my only web page development code that I currently have on hand. But I also wanted to showcase a studious tenacity to acclimate to another discipline and execute.
