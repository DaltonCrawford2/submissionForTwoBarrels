About Project:
After a Programmer/Animator approached me to apply to his Sales Animation team, I balked due to not having a readily available portfolio. But they were not taking "no" for an answer.
The concept came to mind that I should just show them that I can do the job, I would just creat a game, assets created by me and scripted by me. 

Obviously, time was not in abundance, so scope came into play and the main objective to have working code was the priority.

I took a week or to accumulate references, model out arcade cabinets and texture them. 
Then I brought everything into Unity. 
Here I wished I could take the time to build out a game level that emulated a real life arcade from the 90's ... but I had to show the team *SOMETHING* and fast. 
All that was really needed was a beta with code that allowed for a working engine.

Does not mean I am wild about the basic room that this build takes place in, but one had to start somewhere and not worry about the details at the early stages.

I programmed out a simple control on the camera, and recorded a welcoming note. 
The team was shortly disbanded after my interview.

I would return to make a more fleshed out iteration with aims to show off to perspective employers, my code does contain commented out notes that allude to the changes made.
The cage-like area was replaced with a modeled out tri level aracde building complete with bathrooms up front, a prize counter, a theatre room and a staircase leading upstairs for more cabinets.

The further aim, was that specific arcade machines would contain mini-games. 
These games were concepted and code for such was in the infancy stages. Mini-games were not implented in any build of this project.

I would veer away from this project for a myriad of reasons. However, I tend to return to the code as a basis for other projects.

I like to think that this project stressed a quick transition from ideation to rough draft 
... but more importantly, reminded me to utilized what resources were available to me as well as my mindful abilities to reach a resolution and deliverable.

In this repository, I will upload the code as well as zipped folders that contain the .exe of the deliverable ... in all of it's rushed glory. 
There will be one zipped folder for the application that runs on Mac as well as another that will be for PCs.
