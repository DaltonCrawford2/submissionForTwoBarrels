Hello and thank you once again for your time today!


The aim for this repository, is to showcase an established aptitude in using programming for problem solving.
Yes, this is mostly with a focus of game design, but I do believe the basic concepts remain the same and transfer over, almost, seamlessly.

Regardless if it was for a class assignment or for a randomm query to myself ...
I want to ensure that it is clear that I have used code to address a concept possibility. Personal objective as well as in collaborative efforts.

I will be setting up multiple branches in this repository and each branch will pertain to a different project and contain whatever applicable scripts for said project.
I will attempt to also upload any executable files, if possible.

I do hope that this will suffice to at least demonstrate a foundation.

May this be the groundwork for helping each other in an array of objectives, environments and discoveries.

Dalton
